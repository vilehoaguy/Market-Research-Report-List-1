<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torrefied Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The torrefied pellets market primarily consists of two key production methods: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen, enhancing its energy density and making it more suitable for transport and combustion. Steam explosion (SE), on the other hand, applies high-pressure steam followed by rapid decompression, breaking down the biomass structure and increasing its reactivity. Both methods aim to improve biomass feedstock quality for energy applications, contributing to a sustainable energy future.</p></p>
