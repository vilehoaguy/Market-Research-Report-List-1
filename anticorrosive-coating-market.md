<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticorrosive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-borne Coating</li><li>Water-borne Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anticorrosive coating market features two primary types: solvent-borne coatings and water-borne coatings. Solvent-borne coatings use organic solvents as a carrier, providing strong adhesion and durability, making them suitable for harsh environments. However, they may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during application. In contrast, water-borne coatings utilize water as the primary solvent, offering lower VOC levels and enhanced safety and environmental benefits. They are increasingly preferred for commercial and industrial applications due to their ease of use and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
