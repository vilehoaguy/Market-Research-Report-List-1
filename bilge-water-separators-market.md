<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bilge Water Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Separator</li><li>Centrifugal Separator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bilge water separators market primarily consists of two types: gravity separators and centrifugal separators. Gravity separators utilize density differences to separate oil and water, allowing lighter oil to float and be skimmed off. In contrast, centrifugal separators employ rotational force to accelerate the separation process, effectively leveraging centrifugal force to remove oil from bilge water. Both types are essential for ensuring compliance with environmental regulations by treating oily waste before discharge, thus protecting marine ecosystems.</p></p>
