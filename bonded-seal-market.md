<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Seal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Self Centralising Type</li><li>Self Centralising Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bonded Seal Market is categorized into two main types: Non-Self Centralising Type and Self-Centralising Type. Non-Self Centralising Seals require manual positioning during installation, which can lead to difficulties in alignment and sealing performance. In contrast, Self-Centralising Seals automatically adjust to the mating surfaces, ensuring uniform compression and better sealing integrity. This enhancement in installation efficiency and performance makes Self-Centralising Seals more popular in applications requiring reliability and ease of use, while Non-Self Centralising Seals may be cost-effective for simpler tasks.</p></p>
